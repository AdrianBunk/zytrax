# Zytrax

ZyTrax is an easy to use music sequencer with an interface heavily 
inspired by 90's "tracker" software (most specifically [Impulse
Tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_Tracker)).

While contemporary software that uses this approach exists, it 
usually has a high entry barrier because it maintains compatibility 
with old formats.

In contrast to this, ZyTrax starts afresh with an user friendly 
approach (no hex numbers, pure plugin-based architecture, inlined 
automation envelopes, smart automations, zoomable patterns and a 
simple pattern/orderlist layout).
